- The main aim of connecting external database to the python file is used to do 
  serializing and /deserializing the data, to make it as persistent data or 
  permenent data 
- It is necessary to install external module while connecting two software like
  python and mysql
- pip install pymysql 
  This module has some inbuilt classes , methods and functions to perform connection
  between the python and mysql

Steps to connect :
1. Need to import external module 
    import pymysql 
2. Use connect method to pass credentials of external database for connection 
   con_obj = pymysql.connect(par1,par2,par3) 
   par1 -> user
   par2 -> password
   par3 -> host 
3. Once the connection is established connect method returns the connection 
    details , store it in a variable and it becomes the connection object. 
4. Create cursor object with the help of connection objects and cursor method
    cur_obj = con_obj.cursor()
    This object helps us to go inside the external database and perform CRUD 
    operations
5. Use exceute method to run the sql quries
    cur_obj.exceute(---sql query---)
6. Use looping statements to display the data when we are performing the read operation 
7. Need to save the changes when we are performing insertion, modification, and deletion
    operations. Use commit method as follows.
    con_obj.commit()
8. Use row count method to display the actual count of rows as be updated
    cur_obj.rowcount
9.Close the connection between python file and a database using close method

Note:exceutemany() internaly iterate through list of values during each iteration it 
  will take each tuple value and store individual values into the placeholder and it 
  pass the value to its respective column and save the data.
