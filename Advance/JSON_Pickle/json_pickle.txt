JSON:
- It stands for javascript object notation and it ia a individual module present in python 
- It is a lightweight architecture used to connect between two different applications
- In this we need to serialize and deserialize the data in the form of dictnory 

4 Methods in JSON module
1. Loads() :  It is used for deserializing the data present in same file 
2. Load() : It is used for deserializing of a data present in different file or external file 
3. Dumps() : It is used for serializing the data present in same file 
2. Dump() : It is used for serializing of a data present in different file or external file 

Note:
1. Loads method will work on the data present in same file . it accepts the data only the string 
   format and that need to be in the form of key and value pair and connects to dictnory.

2. Dumps method is used to serialize the data present in same file it accepts any type of data 
   and dumps in the form of strings.

3. Load method is used to deserilaize the data present in external file it accepts file object and 
   deserialize the data into its original format 
   json.load(file_obj)

4. Dump method is used to serialize the data to an external file. it accepts data in dump as the 
   first parameter and loacton to dump as a second parameter
   json.dump(par1,par2) 
   par1 -> data to dump 
   par2 -> loc to dump

Pickle:
- It is a module in python used to pickling and unpickling of data in bytes format.
- pickling means accept the data and convert into bytes format 
- unpickling means convert the bytes data into its original format.

- For pickling we have dumps and dump method for data present in same and external file 
  respectively
- For unpickling we have loads and load method for data present in same and external file 
  respectively

- It accepts any type of data and pickle into bytes
- When pickling and unpickling data present in external file we need to use write binary(wb)
  mode of operation for dump method and read binary(rb) mode of operation for load method.77yn
