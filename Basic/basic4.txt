Control Statements: These are the statements which are used to control and flow of execution of a program 
    Types:
        Branching/Conditional Statements
            if 
            if else
            if elif
            nested if 
            match case 
        Looping Statements
            for 
              -range
              -iterable
            while 

Branching Statements:This are statements used to check some the conditions or make some decisions
    If statements: Here if condition is True it exceutes 'if statements' or else terminates
        if condition:
            #statements
    If-else statements: Here if condition is true it exceutes otherwise it exceutes the else statements 
        Else block will not accept any condition else block is optional block 
        if condition:
            #statements
        else:
            #statements
    If-elif statements: Used when there are multiple conditions to check 
        If any one of the condition is true the corresponding block exceutes and rest are skipped
        if condition:
            #statements 
        elif conditon:
            #statements
        else:
            #statements
    Nested if: A if statement inside another if statement.
    Used for checking multiple levelsof conditions
        if condition:
            #statements
            if condition:
                #statements
    Match Case: Used as an alternative to multiple if-elif statements 
        It matches a value against different possible cases 
        match variable:
            case value1:
                #statement
            case value2:
                #statement
            case _:
                #default case 

Looping: These statement are used to repeat a block of code based on condition 
    The block will repeated untill the condition is False 

    For Loop: For loop is used to iterate over a sequence 
    Range
    Syntax: for variable in range(start,stop,step):
                #statement
    Note: Start, stop, step value must be integers or else python will rise Type Error 
          Step value cant be zero or else python will rise Value Error
    Iterable 
    Syntax: for variable in iterable:
                #statement 

    While Loop: While loop exceutes as long as the condition is True 
    Syntax: initialization 
                while condition:
                    #statement
                    update 

Break Statement: Break is used to forcefully terminate the loop based on a condition 
    Note: In case of nested loop break will terminate the immediate loop 
    Ex: for i in range(1,10):
            if i==4:
                break
            print(i,end=" ")
    op: 1 2 3

Continue: It is used to forcefully continue the loop by skipping present iteration 
    Ex: for i in range(1,5):
            if i==2:
                continue
            print(i,end=" ")
    op: 1 3 4 

Pass: To create empty block in python to avoid indintation error we use pass 
    Ex: n=int(input())
        if n==1:
            pass
        else:
            print('No pass')

String Formatting:
Without format:
    a,b=10,20
    print("a value is",a , "b value is",b)

Using format:
    print(" a value is {} and b value is {}".format(a,b))
    op: a value is 10 and b value is 20

    print(" a value is {a} and b value is {b}".format(a,b))
    op: a value is 10 and b value is 20

Using f string:
    print(f"a value is {a} and b value is {b}")
    op:a value is 10 and b value is 20
