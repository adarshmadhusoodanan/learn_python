Control Statements: 
    These are the statements which are used 
    to control and flow of execution of a program 

    Types:
        1. Branching/Conditional Statements
            if 
            if else
            if elif
            nested if 
            match case 

        2. Looping Statements
            for 
              -range
              -iterable
            while 

Branching Statements:
    This are statements used to check 
    some the conditions or make some decisions

    If statements: 
        Here if condition is True it exceutes 'if statements' or else terminates

        if condition:
            #statements

    If-else statements: 
        Here if condition is true it exceutes otherwise it exceutes the else statements 
        Else block will not accept any condition else block is optional block 

        if condition:
            #statements
        else:
            #statements

    If-elif statements: 
        Used when there are multiple conditions to check 
        If any one of the condition is true the corresponding block exceutes and rest are skipped

        if condition:
            #statements 
        elif conditon:
            #statements
        else:
            #statements

    Nested if: 
        A if statement inside another if statement.
        Used for checking multiple levelsof conditions

        if condition:
            #statements
            if condition:
                #statements

    Match Case: 
        Used as an alternative to multiple if-elif statements 
        It matches a value against different possible cases 

        match variable:
            case value1:
                #statement
            case value2:
                #statement
            case _:
                #default case 

Looping: 
    These statement are used to repeat a block of code based on condition 
    The block will repeated untill the condition is False 

    For Loop: 
        For loop is used to iterate over a sequence 

    => Range
        Syntax: 
            for variable in range(start,stop,step):
                    #statement

        Note: Start, stop, step value must be integers or else python will rise Type Error 
            Step value cant be zero or else python will rise Value Error
            
    => Iterable 
        Syntax: for variable in iterable:
                    #statement 

    While Loop: 
        While loop exceutes as long as the condition is True 
    Syntax:     
        initialization 
                while condition:
                    #statement
                    update 

Break Statement: 
    Break is used to forcefully terminate the loop based on a condition 
    Note: 
        In case of nested loop break will terminate the immediate loop 
    Ex: 
        for i in range(1,10):
            if i==4:
                break
            print(i,end=" ")
    op: 1 2 3

Continue: 
    It is used to forcefully continue the loop by skipping present iteration 
    Ex: 
        for i in range(1,5):
            if i==2:
                continue
            print(i,end=" ")
    op: 1 3 4 

Pass: 
    To create empty block in python to avoid indintation error we use pass 
    Ex: 
        n=int(input())
        if n==1:
            pass
        else:
            print('No pass')
