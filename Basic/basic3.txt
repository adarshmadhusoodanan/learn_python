Operator : Symbol used to perform operation is called Operator.
Operator : Values on which operation are performed is called operands.

Types of Operator:
Based on number of operands:
    Uniary
    Binary
    Trinary
Based on Operation:
    Arithmetic:
        +,-,*,/,%,//,**
    Relational/Comparision:
        ==,!=,<,>,<=,>=
    Logical:
        and , or , not 
    Bitwise:
        &,|,^,<<,>>,~
    Assigned:
        =
        Short hand assignment:
            +=,/=,%=,//=,**=,&=,|=,^=,<<=,>>=
Based on Operator:
    Membership:
        in , not in
    Identity:
        is , is not
    Slicing:
        :
    Dot:
        .
    Decoration:
        @

1. Arithmetic Operator:
+ :
    int + int -> int
    int + float -> float
    int + complex -> complex
    float +  complex -> complex
    complex + + complex -> complex
    int + string -> Typeerror
    float + string -> Typeerror
    complex + string -> Typeerror

- :
    int - int -> int
    int - complex -> complex
    int - complex -> complex
    float - complex -> complex
    complex - complex -> complex
    float - string -> Typeerror
    complex - string -> Typeerror
    string - string -> Typeerror

* :
    int * int -> int 
    int * float -> float
    int * complex -> complex
    float * complex -> complex
    complex * complex -> complex
    int * string -> string
    float * string -> Typeerror
    complex * string -> Typeerror
    string * string -> Typeerror

/ :
    int / int -> int 
    int / float -> float 
    If any operand is complex return type complex
    If any operand is string return type  error 

// :
    int // int -> int 
    int // float -> float 
    float // float -> float 
    If any operand is complex or string return type is Type Error 

**:
    a**b -> a power b 

2. Relational/Comparision : This operator are used to compare two values.
    There are six operators
    It return boolean values (True or False)
    >,<,<=,>=  will not supports for complex data type
    ==,!=  will work for all type of data 

ASCII: It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange
Range of ASCII 0-127
    A-Z -> 65-90
    a-z -> 97-122
    0-9 -> 48-57
    special character 

ordinal() -> ord() -> in-built function.
which takes char and returns ASCII values
ord(char) -> ASCII 

character() -> chr() -> in-built function.
which takes ASCII value and returns the character.
chr() -> chr

3. Logical Operators : This operator are used to compare the conditions.
    There are three logical operator and,or,not.
    It returns boolean values True or False.

        and
    C1 |  C2  | Res         C1 |  C2  | Res           Cond | Res  
   ----|------|-----       ----|------|-----         ------|-----
    T  |  F   |  F          T  |  F   |  T              T  | F
    T  |  T   |  T          T  |  T   |  T              F  | T
    F  |  T   |  F          F  |  F   |  T
    F  |  F   |  F          F  |  F   |  F

Assignment operator : This is used to assign the values to the variable
