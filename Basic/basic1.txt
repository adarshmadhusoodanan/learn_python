Software: 
        Group of program written and arranged in an order 
        to achieve multiple task 

There are two types of Software:
    1. System Software 
    2. Application Software

Operating Software: 
        It is an interface between user and the machine 
            Ex: Android,IOS,Window,Ubantu,MacOS,Linux

    Architecture:
           user

        Application
            |
          shell
            |
         kernel
            |
        hardware

    Kernel is core of Operating System

Python: 
        Python is a high level, object oriented, dynamically typed, 
        interpreted scripting laungage as well as programming laungage 

Laungage: 
        It is a medium of communication

Classification of Laungage:

1. Based on Human Readability and machine Readability
    High Level : 
            Easy for humans to read and write  
    Low Level : 
            Machine level not easy to read and write

2. Based on Classes and objects
    Structure Oriented : 
            They dont need object and classes
    Object Oriented : 
            Supports both classes and objects 

3. Based on type decision 
    Statically typed : 
            Type of the variable is declared at compile time 
    Dynamically typed : 
            Type of the variable is decided during run time 

4. Based on Exceution 
    Programming laungage : 
                In programming laungage entire file will be complied 
                If there is any error no lines will be exceuted 
    Scripting laungage : 
                In scripting laungage line by line interprtation takes place 
                interprtation takes place until interpreter reaches a line with error
