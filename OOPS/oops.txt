            object oriented programming in python
why we need OOPS
- basically Oops is required to create our own data types
    All the states and behaviour of data type is defined inside there respective class
    for example we have predefined class str to represent string data type
    similarly we have predefined class int to represent integer data type
    but if we want to represent student data type then we have to create our own class
- By using OOPS we can achieve the real time senarious such as an operator showing multiple 
  behaviour or function showing a multiple behavior based on the situtaion.

class is blueprint / design / structure of real world object
-----
object is an instance of class
------

attributes are the members of class
----------
    -> 2 types
        - variables or states (variables which are declared inside class)
                + class variable
                + instance variable
        - methods or behaviors (function which are defined inside class)
                + class method
                + static method
                + instance method
                    = normal instance method
                    = magic / dunder instance method

variables

1. class variable : 

- universal variable for all objects of class
- it is also called static variable
- it will be created at the time of class loading
- it is defined inside class but outside any method
- it is shared by all objects of class
- it can be accessed by using class name or by using self keyword inside instance method
- it is used to store common property of all objects of class

2. instance variable : 

- unique variable for each object of class
- it is defined inside constructor by using self keyword
- it is created at the time of object creation
- it can be accessed by using self keyword inside instance method
- it is used to store unique property of each object of class


3. local variable : 

- variable which are defined inside method / function
- it is created at the time of method / function call
- it can be accessed only inside the method / function
- it is destroyed automatically when method / function call is completed

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
methods

1. class method : 

- method which is defined by using @classmethod decorator and it takes cls as first parameter
- it can access only class variable
- it is used to access class variable and to create factory methods

2. static method : 

- method which is defined by using @staticmethod decorator and it doesn't
  take self or cls as first parameter
- it can't access class variable and instance variable
- it is used to create utility methods

3. instance method : 

- method which is defined without any decorator and it takes self as first parameter
- it can access class variable and instance variable
- it is used to access instance variable and to perform operations on instance variable
    -> 2 types
    - normal instance method
      - method which is defined by using self as first parameter

    - magic / dunder instance method
        - method which is defined by using double underscore before and after the method name

class Student:
    school_name = "ABC School"   # class variable

    def __init__(self, name, marks):
        self.name = name          # instance variable
        self.marks = marks

    # Instance Method
    def display(self):
        return f"Name: {self.name}, Marks: {self.marks}, School: {Student.school_name}"

    # Class Method
    @classmethod
    def change_school(cls, new_name):
        cls.school_name = new_name

    # Static Method
    @staticmethod
    def is_passed(marks):
        return marks >= 35

# Using all methods
s1 = Student("Keerthana", 90)

print(s1.display())               # instance method
Student.change_school("XYZ School")   # class method
print(Student.is_passed(90))      # static method
print(s1.display())

# op: 
# Name: Keerthana, Marks: 90, School: ABC School
# True
# Name: Keerthana, Marks: 90, School: XYZ School

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

constructor

- constructor is a special type of method which is used to initialize 
  the object of class
- constructor is defined by using __init__() method
- constructor is called automatically when we create an object of class
- constructor is used to allocate memory for the object
- constructor is used to initialize the instance variables of class

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

self

- self is a special keyword which is used to represent the current object of class
- self is used to access the instance variables and instance methods of class
- self is used to differentiate between instance variable and local variable
- self is used to call the instance methods of class
- self is not a keyword, it is just a convention, we can use any name instead
  of self but it is recommended to use self
